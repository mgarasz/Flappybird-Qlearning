This project attempts to apply a standard Q-Learning algorithm to a Flappy Bird playing agent. 
The agent was demonstrated to successfully learn to play the game at a superhuman level following a pure-greedy. 
Modular adjustments were made to the learning rate to investigate whether a decay scheduler would improve performance.
